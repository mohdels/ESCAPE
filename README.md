# ESCAPE
An interactive website for the Engineering Socials Committee in the Faculty of Engineering at McGill University.
The website allows the committee to upload event tickets for sale, upload photo galleries of their events for people to view after events as well as allow users to create accounts, purchase event tickets, post updates to the website, and interact with other users through trading event tickets, making it a ‘social’ cyber-space.
Note: A domain for the website hasn't been bought yet. Until then, to view the frontend do the following instructions:

1. Download the code from github.
2. Open command prompt/terminal
3. Go to your downloads directory (make sure the code was downloaded in this directory, if not, go to whatever directory the code file was stored in in a similar fashion) using "cd downloads"
4. Go to the frontend file using "cd ESCAPE-frontend"
5. Run the following commands one after the other:
   - npm install
   -  npm run dev
6. As a result, a sample web page should appear at http://localhost:8080/
